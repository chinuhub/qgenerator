Building epadd:

There are 2 versions of ePADD; a full one with the suffix epadd-) that is used for appraisal, processing and delivery modules, and another one (with the prefix epadd-discovery). ePADD is first built as a WAR file, and then packaged in the epadd-launcher project as a -standalone.jar, and then a .exe for Windows, and a .app and .dmg for Mac OS. 

Make sure you have the Java 8 JDK installed, as well as the Java build tools maven and ant, and that mvn and ant are available in your path. Your JAVA_HOME should be pointing to the correct JDK installation directory. You can check this by ensuring that the following command gives the expected output.

$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -version (mac or linux)
$JAVA_HOME\bin\java -version (windows)

First checkout 3 projects from git.

git clone https://github.com/ePADD/epadd.git
git clone https://github.com/ePADD/epadd-launcher.git
git clone https://github.com/ePADD/epadd-settings.git (this MUST be checked out under your home directory, so that it exists under ~/epadd-settings)

To build epadd 
1. in the epadd folder, Type:
./do (or do.bat on windows)

This will build target/epadd-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war and target/epadd-discovery-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war

2. Next, in the epadd-launcher folder, Type: 
./do (do.bat on windows)

When this operation is complete, there should be 6 files in the current folder:
epadd-standalone.jar
epadd.exe
epadd.dmg
and -discovery versions of these 3 files.

Note: for developers, it is adequate if the epadd-standalone file gets built. The windows/Mac packager into .exe/.dmg sometimes fail on some platforms, but are not really needed for testing.

Notes:

The muse packages contain most of the Java based code. It is the core engine used in ePADD.  The WebContent folder contains the frontend screens for the application and creates a deployable WAR file.  epadd-launcher bundles up the epadd.war into a standalone, runnable jar using an embedded Tomcat server.

3. To check whether the program built correctly, you can try to run:
java -Xmx2g -jar epadd-standalone.jar

4. To run automated test cases, first quit all running instances of ePADD. Then go to epadd-launcher, edit config.properties with the appropriate paths for your system and type mvn -f pom-test.xml test
The script in epadd-launcher/src/test/resources/feature/epadd.feature will be run.

5. To run the epadd-launcher in a debugger, add the following files to a temp directory and then add that directory to the classpath:
crossdomain.xml	
epadd.war	
index.html	
muse-icon.png

Running TomcatMain as the main class with the VM argument -splash:lib/splash-image.png will give exactly the same behaviour as running epadd-standalone.jar
